This project, a simple Pokedex viewer built with the Django web framework, serves as a practical exercise in backend development, data manipulation, and responsive frontend design.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backend: Python 3 & Django

Data Source: External PokeAPI (consumed via synchronous HTTP requests)

Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5 (for responsive design and styling) & Vanilla JavaScript (for interactivity)

Environment: Virtual Environments (venv)

ðŸ§  Key Learning Outcomes & Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with several core concepts: <br>

API Integration	Consuming   &nbsp;--> parsing, and standardizing data from a third-party REST API (pokeapi.co). <br>

Data Transformation	       &nbsp; --> Implementing server-side data manipulation logic, including filtering PokÃ©mon based on criteria (Weight, Type, Height) and performing custom string operations (e.g., reversing PokÃ©mon names).<br>

Django Views & Context     &nbsp; -->	Managing Django's flow control, processing data within views.py, and passing structured data (context) to templates.<br>

Advanced Filtering	       &nbsp; --> Implementing complex filters in the service layer to handle multiple conditions simultaneously (e.g., "Type X AND Height > Y").<br>

Client-Side Interactivity	 &nbsp; --> Using Vanilla JavaScript to enhance the UX, specifically by adding a persistent Dark Mode toggle and a feature to optionally show/hide a table column via DOM manipulation.<br>

Responsive Design	        &nbsp;  --> Styling complex, scrollable data tables using Bootstrap 5 to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
