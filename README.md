This project, a simple Pokedex viewer built with the Django web framework, serves as a practical exercise in backend development, data manipulation, and responsive frontend design.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Backend: Python 3 & Django

Data Source: External PokeAPI (consumed via synchronous HTTP requests)

Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5 (for responsive design and styling) & Vanilla JavaScript (for interactivity)

Environment: Virtual Environments (venv)

ðŸ§  Key Learning Outcomes & Features
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with several core concepts:
API Integration	Consuming   --> parsing, and standardizing data from a third-party REST API (pokeapi.co).
Data Transformation	        --> Implementing server-side data manipulation logic, including filtering PokÃ©mon based on criteria (Weight, Type, Height) and performing custom string operations (e.g., reversing PokÃ©mon names).
Django Views & Context      -->	Managing Django's flow control, processing data within views.py, and passing structured data (context) to templates.
Advanced Filtering	        --> Implementing complex filters in the service layer to handle multiple conditions simultaneously (e.g., "Type X AND Height > Y").
Client-Side Interactivity	  --> Using Vanilla JavaScript to enhance the UX, specifically by adding a persistent Dark Mode toggle and a feature to optionally show/hide a table column via DOM manipulation.
Responsive Design	          --> Styling complex, scrollable data tables using Bootstrap 5 to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
